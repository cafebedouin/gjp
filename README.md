This is a repository for forecasting: R scripts, data, etc. If you do not know how to program, these could also serve to help learn to do some useful tasks for forecasting.

I am not a programmer by occupation. Everything that is here I learned trying to make useful scripts for forecasting and by reading books like Book of R: A First Course in Programming and Statistics by Tilman M. Davies. 

Starting

1. Download RStudio from the following url:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

2. Choose a script to run, e.g., yield.R and ./functions/simple-probability.R
2. Install the necessary libraries, listed in the scripts, e.g., xml2, lubridate, and dplyr.
3. Put the supporting R script functions in the right directory so they can be found.
4. Load the script, i.e., open file and click on the Source button, top-right.
5. Run it in the console by calling the function: > yield()

See the results. Review the script and grok in fullness. Then, maybe move on to fred.R and update.R.

Good luck!
